# TACTICAL RAG DOCUMENT INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM
## OPERATOR GUIDE

## WHAT IS THIS SYSTEM?

This system lets you ask questions about your documents and get instant answers from an AI. Think of it as having an expert who has read all your mission documents and can answer any question about them immediately.

**What it does:**
- Reads PDF files, Word documents, and text files
- Works with scanned documents (uses OCR to read images)
- Answers questions based on what's in your documents
- Shows you which documents it used to answer
- Works completely offline (no internet needed)

---

## QUICK START (FIRST TIME)

### What You Need:
- A computer with Windows
- Docker Desktop installed (ask IT if you don't have it)
- This deployment package on a USB drive

### Steps:

**1. Copy the deployment folder from USB to your computer**
   - Copy the entire folder to your Desktop or Documents

**2. Make sure Docker Desktop is running**
   - Look for the Docker whale icon in your taskbar (bottom right)
   - If you don't see it, open Docker Desktop from Start Menu
   - Wait until it says "Docker Desktop is running"

**3. Add your documents**
   - Open the `documents` folder
   - Copy your mission documents into this folder
   - Supported files: PDF, Word (.docx), Text (.txt), Markdown (.md)

**4. Start the system**
   - Double-click `deploy.bat`
   - Wait 3-5 minutes for first-time setup
   - A browser window will open automatically

**5. Start asking questions**
   - Type your question in the text box
   - Click "EXECUTE" or press Enter
   - The system will answer based on your documents

## TIPS FOR BETTER RESULTS

### Asking Good Questions:
- **Be specific:** "What are the medical requirements for deployment?" instead of "Tell me about requirements"
- **Reference topics:** "Summarize the section about vehicle maintenance"
- **Ask for sources:** The system automatically shows which documents it used

### What Works Well:
- Finding specific information across multiple documents
- Summarizing long documents
- Comparing information between documents
- Extracting data points (dates, names, procedures)

### What Doesn't Work:
- Questions about things not in your documents
- Real-time information (weather, current events)
- Documents you haven't uploaded yet
- Password-protected PDFs

---

## COMMON ISSUES

### "The page won't load"
**Fix:**
- Check if Docker Desktop is running (whale icon in taskbar)
- Wait 1-2 minutes - system might still be starting
- Try manually going to http://localhost:7860
- Run `stop.bat` then `deploy.bat` to restart

### "System says no documents found"
**Fix:**
- Check that documents are in the `documents` folder
- Make sure files are PDF, DOCX, TXT, or MD format
- Run `swap-mission.bat` to re-index

### "Answers don't match my documents"
**Fix:**
- You likely added documents after the system started
- Run `swap-mission.bat` to clear and re-index
- Check that the right documents are shown in the document list

### "System is very slow"
**This is normal for:**
- First startup (downloads AI models, 15-30 minutes)
- Scanned PDFs (OCR takes 1-2 minutes per page)
- Large document sets (indexing takes time)

**If it's always slow:**
- Close other programs using memory
- Check computer has at least 8GB RAM available
- Restart Docker Desktop

---

## WHAT FILES DO WHAT

**deploy.bat** - Start the system (double-click this)
**stop.bat** - Stop the system safely
**swap-mission.bat** - Change to different documents
**documents/** - Put your files here
**docker-compose.yml** - System configuration (don't touch)
**README.md** - This file
