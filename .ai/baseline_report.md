## Summary

Current RAG system baseline performance (v3.5):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Average Total Time** | 9117ms (9.1s) |
| Embedding Time | 200ms |
| Vector Search Time | 50ms |
| Reranking Time | 117ms |
| LLM Generation Time | 8750ms |

---

## Bottleneck Analysis

**Primary Bottleneck:** LLM

**Time Distribution:**
- Embedding: 2.2%
- Search: 0.5%
- Rerank: 1.3%
- LLM: 96.0%

---

## Comparison with Roadmap Assumptions

**Roadmap Assumption:** 80,000ms (80s) total time
**Actual Baseline:** 9117ms (9.1s)

**Roadmap Assumption:** LLM is 99% bottleneck (79/80s)
**Actual Bottleneck:** llm is 96.0% of total time

---

## Recommendations


### LLM is the bottleneck (as expected)
- **Phase 2 (LLM optimization)** is HIGH priority
- **Phase 3 (Context optimization)** is HIGH priority
- Roadmap assumptions VALIDATED
- Proceed with full optimization plan
