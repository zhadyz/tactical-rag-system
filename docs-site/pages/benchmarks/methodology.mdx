# Benchmark Methodology

This document outlines the comprehensive methodology used to benchmark Apollo RAG's performance characteristics, ensuring transparent, reproducible, and fair measurements.

## Overview

Apollo's benchmarking methodology is designed to provide transparent, reproducible performance measurements across key RAG system dimensions: **latency**, **throughput**, **accuracy**, and **resource utilization**. All benchmarks are conducted in a controlled environment with standardized test data and clearly documented hardware specifications.

### Benchmark Objectives

- **Performance Characterization**: Establish baseline metrics for query latency, inference speed, and system throughput
- **Optimization Validation**: Quantify the impact of architectural optimizations (KV cache preservation, parallel initialization, multi-tier caching)
- **Resource Profiling**: Measure GPU, CPU, and memory utilization patterns under various load conditions
- **Accuracy Baselines**: Establish retrieval quality and answer relevance metrics

## Test Environment

All benchmarks were conducted in a controlled environment with consistent hardware and software configurations.

<Callout type="warning">
**Query Diversity**: The benchmark query set intentionally includes ambiguous, multi-faceted, and edge-case questions to stress-test retrieval and generation quality, not just measure optimal-path performance.
</Callout>

## Metrics Definitions

### 1. Latency Metrics

**End-to-End Query Latency**: Total time from API request reception to response completion.

| Metric | Definition | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| **P50 Latency** | Median query time | less than 15s (simple mode) | StageTimer per-query tracking |
| **P95 Latency** | 95th percentile query time | less than 25s (adaptive mode) | Histogram distribution |
| **P99 Latency** | 99th percentile query time | less than 30s | Long-tail analysis |
| **TTFT** | Time to first token | less than 500ms | SSE streaming timestamp |

**Stage Breakdown**:
```
Total Latency = Security + Cache Lookup + Retrieval + Embedding +
                Vector Search + Reranking + Generation + Confidence Scoring
```

Example breakdown for cache miss (simple mode):
- Security Checks: less than 5ms
- Cache Lookup: 0.86ms (Redis query cache)
- Query Embedding: 50ms (CPU, L2 cache miss)
- Vector Search: 100ms (Qdrant HNSW)
- LLM Generation: 8-12s (80-100 tok/s)
- Confidence Scoring: 500ms (parallel)
- **Total**: ~9-13s

### 2. Throughput Metrics

**Inference Throughput**: Token generation rate during LLM inference.

| Metric | Definition | Target | Measurement |
|--------|------------|--------|-------------|
| **Tokens/Second** | LLM generation speed | 80-100 tok/s | llama.cpp performance counter |
| **Queries/Minute** | Sustained query rate | 4-6 queries/min | Concurrent load testing |
| **Cache Hit Rate** | Query cache effectiveness | 60-80% | Redis hit/miss ratio |

### 3. Accuracy Metrics

| **MRR** | Mean Reciprocal Rank of first relevant doc | more than 0.85 | Position tracking |
| **Confidence Score** | System's self-assessed answer quality | Calibrated | Weighted signal aggregation |

**Confidence Scoring Formula**:
```
confidence = 0.30 * retrieval_quality +
             0.40 * answer_relevance +
             0.30 * source_consistency
```

### 4. Resource Utilization

## Testing Approach

### Benchmark Phases

**Phase 1: Cold Start Testing**
- Measure system initialization time (parallel component loading)
- Target: less than 30 seconds from container start to first query ready
- Components: Embeddings, LLM, Vector DB, Cache, Reranker

**Phase 2: Warm System Testing**
- Execute 100 diverse queries with empty cache
- Measure baseline latency without cache optimization
- Record per-stage timing breakdowns

**Phase 3: Cache Effectiveness Testing**
- Re-run Phase 2 queries to measure cache hit benefits
- Target: 98% latency reduction on exact matches (less than 1ms vs 50-100ms)
- Validate semantic cache matching (0.95 similarity threshold)

**Phase 4: Load Testing**
- Ramp up concurrent users (1 → 5 → 10 → 20)
- Measure throughput degradation and latency increase
- Identify bottlenecks (GPU inference, Redis contention)

**Phase 5: Optimization Validation**
- A/B test individual optimizations:
  - KV cache preservation: 40-60% speedup validation
  - Parallel initialization: 3.4x startup speedup validation
  - BGE reranker: 85% faster than LLM reranking validation

## Baseline Measurements

### Startup Performance

| Metric | Baseline (Sequential) | Optimized (Parallel) | Improvement |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Startup Time | 78 seconds | 23 seconds | **3.4x faster** |
| Component Init | Sequential loading | 3-group parallelization | 55s saved |
| First Query Ready | 80+ seconds | 25-30 seconds | 3x faster |

**Parallel Initialization Groups**:
- **Group 1** (parallel): embedding_cache, embeddings, bm25_data, llm → ~12s
- **Group 2** (parallel): cache_manager, vectorstore, bm25_retriever, llm_warmup → ~8s
- **Group 3** (parallel): metadata, conversation_memory, confidence_scorer → ~3s

### Query Latency Baselines

| Mode | Cache Status | Median (P50) | P95 | P99 |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----|-----|
| **Simple** | Cold (miss) | 12.5s | 15.2s | 18.4s |
| **Simple** | Warm (hit) | 0.9ms | 1.2ms | 2.1ms |
| **Adaptive** | Cold (miss) | 18.3s | 24.7s | 29.1s |
| **Adaptive** | Warm (hit) | 1.1ms | 1.5ms | 2.4ms |

**Cache Hit Rate Over Time**:
- Initial 100 queries: 0% hit rate (cold cache)
- After 500 queries: 45% hit rate
- Steady state: 60-80% hit rate (depends on query diversity)

### Retrieval Accuracy Baselines

| Strategy | Recall@3 | Precision@3 | MRR | Avg Confidence |
|----------|---------|------------|-----|----------------|
| **Dense Only** | 0.87 | 0.78 | 0.82 | 0.71 |
| **Hybrid (Dense + BM25)** | 0.92 | 0.85 | 0.88 | 0.78 |
| **Advanced (Multi-query + HyDE + Rerank)** | 0.94 | 0.89 | 0.91 | 0.83 |

## Fairness Considerations

<Callout type="warning">
**Transparency Commitment**: These benchmarks represent real-world performance on a specific hardware configuration. Results will vary based on GPU model, document corpus characteristics, and query complexity distribution.
</Callout>

### Hardware Limitations

- **RTX 5080 Constraint**: PyTorch sm_120 incompatibility forces CPU embeddings (50ms overhead per query)
- **Single GPU**: No multi-GPU benchmarks; results reflect single-device throughput
- **WSL2 Overhead**: ~5-10% performance penalty vs native Linux (Docker/WSL2 virtualization)

### Benchmark Design Choices

| Choice | Rationale | Impact on Results |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Q5_K_M Quantization** | Balances speed (80-100 tok/s) and quality | Faster than Q8, slightly lower accuracy than FP16 |
| **8K Context Window** | Standard for Llama 3.1 8B | Shorter context = faster, but limited for long docs |
| **0.0 Temperature** | Deterministic generation | Reproducible but less creative answers |
| **Top-K=3 Retrieval** | Fast, focused retrieval | May miss relevant docs in top-5 or top-10 |

### Excluded Scenarios

The following scenarios are **not** included in baseline benchmarks but may be added in future testing:

- **Multi-modal queries** (images + text)
- **Multi-language retrieval** (non-English corpora)
- **Streaming vs batch processing** (SSE vs synchronous)
- **Multi-turn conversations** (10+ exchange history)
- **Cross-document reasoning** (requires more than 5 sources)

## Limitations

### Known Bottlenecks

- **CPU Embeddings**: RTX 5080 PyTorch incompatibility adds 50ms per query (embedding generation)
- **Single-threaded Inference**: llama.cpp requires thread-safe single executor (ThreadPoolExecutor with max_workers=1)
- **Redis Single-instance**: Distributed caching not tested; production may require Redis Cluster
- **No Multi-GPU**: Benchmarks reflect single-GPU throughput; model sharding not implemented

### Query Complexity Bias

- Simple queries (40% of test set) are over-represented vs real-world distribution
- Complex reasoning queries (20%) may underestimate tail latencies
- Benchmark queries are pre-vetted; production includes typos, ambiguity, adversarial inputs

### Document Corpus Limitations

- 100K documents is mid-scale; enterprise deployments may exceed 1M+ documents
- Primarily English-language corpus (no multilingual benchmarking)
- No code repositories or structured data (CSV, JSON) included

<Callout type="info">
**Continuous Improvement**: Benchmark methodology is versioned (v4.0) and will be expanded with additional test cases, hardware configurations, and accuracy evaluations in future releases.
</Callout>
