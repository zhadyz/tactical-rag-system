## Bottleneck Analysis

### üî¥ PRIMARY BOTTLENECK: LLM Generation (62% - 16.2 seconds)

**Root Cause**: Ollama llama3.1:8b model taking too long to generate responses

**Optimization Strategies** (in priority order):

1. **Verify GPU Acceleration** (IMMEDIATE)
   ```bash
   # Check if GPU is being used during query
   nvidia-smi -l 1
   ```
   - If GPU not active, fix Ollama GPU passthrough
   - Expected: 3-5x speedup

2. **Test Faster Models** (QUICK WIN)
   - Try `llama3.1:7b` (smaller)
   - Try `phi-2` (Microsoft, very fast)
   - Try `qwen2:1.5b` (extremely fast)
   - Expected: 2-4x speedup

3. **Optimize Prompts** (MEDIUM EFFORT)
   - Reduce prompt token count
   - Simplify system instructions
   - Remove unnecessary context
   - Expected: 20-30% speedup

4. **Enable Streaming** (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED!)
   - Backend supports `/api/query/stream` endpoint
   - Frontend needs to use streaming
   - Reduces perceived latency dramatically

5. **Aggressive Caching** (ALREADY WORKING!)
   - Current cache: 11-25ms for hits
   - Expand cache size
   - Implement query normalization
   - Expected: 70-90% cache hit rate

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SECONDARY BOTTLENECK: Retrieval (38% - 9.9 seconds)

**Root Cause**: Embedding generation + vector search taking time

**Optimization Strategies**:

1. **Embedding Cache** (MEDIUM EFFORT)
   - Cache embeddings for common queries
   - Redis-backed with TTL
   - Expected: 50-80% speedup for repeated queries

2. **Batch Processing** (ADVANCED)
   - Process multiple queries in parallel
   - Optimize vectorstore access patterns
   - Expected: 20-30% speedup

3. **Index Optimization** (ADVANCED)
   - ChromaDB index tuning
   - Consider HNSW parameters
   - Expected: 10-20% speedup
